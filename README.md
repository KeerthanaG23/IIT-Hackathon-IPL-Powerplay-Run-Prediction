# IIT-Hackathon-IPL-Powerplay-Run-Prediction
##ABOUT THE COMPETITION
<ul>
  <li>For upcoming T20 matches, participants should submit their code to predict the score at the end of 6 overs in each of the innings.</li>
    <li>This academic competition has been designed for beginners to learn and compete as well as professionals to demonstrate their capabilities. Even those who are new to data science, but have the interest to learn can go through the resources available online and try participating by using simple mathematical models.</li>
<li>Participation can be as an individual or as a team with a maximum of 4 members.</li>
<li>The individual/team with the lowest error in their prediction over best 35 matches matches will be declared as the winner of the IIT Madras BS Degreeâ€™s Cricket Hackathon 2023.</li>
</ul>
